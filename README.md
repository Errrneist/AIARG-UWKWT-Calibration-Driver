## Update History
#### Stage I: Drafting and Function Testing
* Update 20171207: Project created.
* Update 20171209: Finished theory building and a flow chart is being created.
* Update 20171210: Downloaded ULx library and documents.
* Update 20171217: Completed first test program.
* Update 20180126: Completed project structure.
* Update 20180128: Uploaded code from Perforce to Github for developing convience.
* Update 20180220: Completed the main panel. Able to switch panels in between different VIs.
* Update 20180301: There is a Functions VI being created to demonstrate the features in the program.
#### Stage II: Framework Development
* Update 20180315: There is a "BIG BUG" issue that sample button doesn't latch when pressed once.
* Update 20180322: There is a ES file "Normal Beam.vi" File (MK-I) that demonstrates basic functions of the program.
* Update 20180323: Fixed a bug of connecting the axis of the plot to opposite side, and restructured the code.
* Update 20180324: Fixed a small issue that the sample button does not latch.

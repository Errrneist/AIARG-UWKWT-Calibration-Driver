* A software for the University of Washington Kirsten Wind Tunnel to perform [Custom Calibration Tasks](https://github.com/Errrneist/AIARG-UWKWT-Calibration-Driver/blob/master/Documents/KWT_Sidewall_Software_Diagram.pdf). 
* Based on Labview and [ULx](https://www.mccdaq.com/daq-software/universal-library-extensions-lv.aspx) Package for Labview.
* The software reads and samples signals from six channels and processes the sampled data.
* It is capable to sample, record, plot, fit, analyze, and write Post-Processed matrix to a file.
